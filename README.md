# Machine Learning Tools Lab 🧠⚙️

This repository contains a structured set of practical experiments designed to understand and apply core **Machine Learning concepts** using **TensorFlow.js** and **Python**.  
The focus is on hands-on implementation, browser-based ML, and real-world use cases.

### 📌 Overview

- Learn fundamental and applied Machine Learning concepts through guided labs  
- Build and run ML models directly in the browser using TensorFlow.js  
- Explore real-time and interactive ML applications  

Each practical is organized in its own folder with source code and documentation.

### 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome / Edge / Firefox)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Python
- TensorFlow.js (loaded via CDN for browser-based labs)

Run the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Shrushti88/MLTLab_CM23006.git
